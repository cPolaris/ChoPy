# ChoPy

Goal: Swiss Army knife for coder-musicians.

## Current Todo

This project is just getting started. I plan to write this thing for fun over a long period of time.

- Musical object cores: efficient representation of musical primitives.
- Find a cross-platform library for playing sounds.

## Capabilities

A music modeling tool. Representation for music primitives. e.g. individual tone, chord, and multi-track compositions. Operations on primitives: concatenation, superposition, transformation, importing and exporting as different concrete formats. These musical objects should be easy to

ChoPy aims at fast experiments and . The actual serious work should be done in your favorite DAW.

## The Name

Idea: a famous musician's name + conventional suffix "py". Chopin sounds just right.
